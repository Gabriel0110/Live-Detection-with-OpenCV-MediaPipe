# Live-Detection-with-OpenCV-MediaPipe
Live hand and face detection with Google's MediaPipe framework and OpenCV.

To run, you can clone locally and either run main.py or gui.py (obviously, a GUI version if you prefer that, with settings to turn off/on features - see demo video below).

My plan is to add more features to the GUI version, including screenshots and image comparison using my image similarity program currently on my profile.

Thanks to docPhil99 (https://gist.github.com/docPhil99/ca4da12c9d6f29b9cea137b617c7b8b1) for help getting the GUI setup via PyQT, as streaming OpenCV video to QT requires a bit of tinkering with multithreading.
